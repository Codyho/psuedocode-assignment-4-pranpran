remove the jokers
place two cards face down next to eachother
on the side without the other card, place four more cards face down
deal out the remaining cards to two players
each player must then deal themselves a hand of five cards from the cards they have just recived
players must always have five cards in their hand, they may take a card from the cards they were dealt initially after playing a card
Then, flip the center two cards
using their hand, a player can place card that come before or after the card in the center using the order Ace,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,10,Jack,Queen,King,Ace
If neither player can make a move, the cards placed to the side of the two center cardscan be fliped and placed on top of the cards in the middle
once a player runs out of cards, they must place both hands dwon on the center two piles and say "Speed"
